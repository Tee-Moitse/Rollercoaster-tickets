# Rollercoaster-tickets
A tickets seller program

This is a simple Python program that sells tickets for a rollercaoster ride. This program consists of nested if-else conditionals and also user input, in order to determine the height of the person who is eligible to take the ride on the rollercoaster and also prompts user input in order to find out the age of the customer to determine the price they need to pay for the tickets. Not only that, there is also a user input for the pictures and if the customer wants the pictures of their ride and also the price of the pictures.

I have also added a counter in order to count and add up the bill the customer needs to pay according to the inputs they have inserted, and also printing out the total bill that they need to pay.
